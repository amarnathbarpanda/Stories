        <h2>1. The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h2>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the
                    hillside. To
                    entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”


                    When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when
                    they
                    arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.

                    “Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down
                    the
                    hill.

                    Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his
                    amusement,
                    he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.

                    As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really
                    is a
                    wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked
                    grumbling down the hill once more.

                    Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried
                    out as
                    loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they
                    didn’t come
                    to help.

                    At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they
                    went up
                    the hill, they found him weeping.

                    “There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he
                    wailed.

                    An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar,
                    even
                    when he is telling the truth!”</p>

        <h2>2. The Golden Touch</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="text">
                <p>There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by
                    Dionysus, the god of wine.


                    For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to
                    prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.

                    Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item
                    into pure gold.

                    But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had
                    turned to gold in his hand.

                    Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”

                    Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too,
                    turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He searched high and low, but
                    couldn’t find something that he could eat.

                    Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw
                    the
                    biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were
                    ready
                    to be eaten.

                    To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch
                    the
                    grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.

                    He tried a few more times but kept failing.

                    Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m
                    sure the grapes were sour anyway.”</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her
                    only complaint was growing next to an ugly cactus.

                    Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all while the cactus
                    remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed
                    by
                    her own looks.

                    One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose
                    quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.

                    Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though
                    ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed,
                    helping
                    them both through the tough summer, as friends.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the cows, and then
                    bring
                    the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.

                    As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted
                    to
                    buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh
                    strawberries.

                    A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the money I get from
                    today,
                    I’m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk
                    and
                    eggs and get more money!”

                    She continued, “With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other
                    milkmaids
                    jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon,
                    the
                    milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.

                    Drenched, Molly said to herself, “Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now.” She
                    went
                    home with her empty pails.

                    “Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?” Molly’s mother asked.

                    “I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails,” she
                    answered.

                    “Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don’t count your chickens until they hatch?’”

                <p>There was an old owl who lived in an oak tree. Every day, he observed incidents that occurred around
                    him.

                    Yesterday, he watched as a young boy helped an old man carry a heavy basket. Today, he saw a young
                    girl shouting at her mother. The more he saw, the less he spoke.

                    As the days went on, he spoke less but heard more. The old owl heard people talking and telling
                    stories.

                    He heard a woman saying an elephant jumped over a fence. He heard a man saying that he had never
                    made a mistake.

                    The old owl had seen and heard what happened to people. There were some who became better, some who
                    became worse. But the old owl in the tree had become wiser, each and every day.

            <div class="text">
                <p>Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg every day. The egg provided enough
                    money for the farmer and his wife to support their daily needs. The farmer and his wife continued to
                    be happy for a long time.

                    But, one day, the farmer thought to himself, “Why should we take just one egg a day? Why can’t we
                    take them all at once and make a lot of money?” The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly
                    agreed.

                    Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He
                    killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he
                    opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.

                    The farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource. As the
                    days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. How jinxed and how foolish they
                    were.

        <div class="content">
            <div class="text">
                <p>One day, a farmer was looking for a water source for his farm, when he bought a well from his
                    neighbor. The neighbor, however, was cunning. The next day, as the farmer came to draw water from
                    his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any water.

                    When the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, “I sold you the well, not the water,” and walked
                    away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for justice. He explained what had happened.

                    The emperor called on Birbal, one of his nine, and wisest, courtiers. Birbal proceeded to question
                    the neighbor, “Why don’t you let the farmer take water from the well? You did sell the well to the
                    farmer?”

                    The neighbor replied, “Birbal, I did sell the well to the farmer but not the water within it. He has
                    no right to draw water from the well.”

                    Birbal said, “Look, since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in the farmer’s
                    well. Either you pay rent to the farmer, or take it out immediately.” Realizing that his scheme had
                    failed, the neighbor apologized and went home.</p>

                <p>A lone elephant walked through the forest, looking for friends. She soon saw a monkey and proceeded
                    to ask, ‘Can we be friends, monkey?’

                    The monkey quickly replied, ‘You are big and can’t swing on trees like I do, so I cannot be your
                    friend.’

                    Defeated, the elephant continued to search when it stumbled across a rabbit. She proceeded to ask
                    him, ‘Can we be friends, rabbit?’

                    The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot
                    be my friend.”

                    Then, the elephant continued until she met a frog. She asked, “Will you be my friend, frog?”

                    The frog replied, “You are too big and heavy; you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can’t be
                    my friend.”

                    The elephant continued to ask the animals she met on her way, but always received the same reply.
                    The following day, the elephant saw all the forest animals run in fear. She stopped a bear to ask
                    what was happening and was told the tiger was attacking all the small animals.

                    The elephant wanted to save the other animals, so she went to the tiger and said, “Please, sir,
                    leave my friends alone. Do not eat them.”

                    The tiger didn’t listen. He merely told the elephant to mind her own business.

                    Seeing no other way, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away. Upon hearing of the brave
                    tale, the other animals agreed, “You are just the right size to be our friend.”
